Q: 24. Is an Industrial Workman eligible for free legal aid?
A: Another option is to send the application online i.e. by email to NALSA (at nalsa-dla@nic.in). It is also possible to make an application orally â€“ a Paralegal Volunteer or an officer of the concerned Legal Services Institution will assist the person in such cases.
