Q: 71.	Whether a party in a pending case before a Civil Court/Criminal Court or a Statutory Forum may approach Permanent Lok Adalats for adjudication of a case pertaining to a Public Utility Services?
A: Yes, one can apply to get free legal aid at any stage of the case as long as one is eligible to obtain free legal services as per Section 12 of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987. Even if a person had a personal lawyer before and now requires a legal aid lawyer only at the stage of appeal (and is eligible under Section 12 of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987), the person can make an application to avail the same. Even if a person has engaged a private lawyer, he/ she can also get second opinion from Panel Lawyers.
