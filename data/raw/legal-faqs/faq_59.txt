Q: 59.	How will a person get an intimation/information of the acceptance, success, failure, etc. of his application?
A: Legal Aid Defence Counsels are appointed by the District Legal Services Authority to provide legal representation in criminal matters within the district. They are attached to the Legal Aid Defence Counsel office and are dedicated only to provide legal aid services i.e. they cannot take up any private legal cases. They are neither Government pleaders or advocates nor public servants.
