Q: 72.	How can one file an application before the Permanent Lok Adalats for Public Utility Services?
A: Legal aid is provided to the entitled persons through legal services authorities existing from the National to Taluka levels including the NALSA, State Legal Services Authorities, District Legal Services Authorities, Taluka Legal Services Committees, Supreme Court Legal Services Committee and High Court Legal Services Committees. If, however, an application or request for legal aid is received by NALSA, NALSA forwards the same to the concerned Legal Services Institution. Once the application is submitted with the proper authority, it would be perused by the concerned Legal Services Institution as to what action is needed upon the same. The information about the next step on the application would then be sent to the parties concerned. The action taken on an application received would vary from providing counselling/advice to the parties, providing a lawyer to represent them in the court, etc.
