Q: 48.	How can Legal Services Institutions assist victims of domestic violence?
A: Generally no. The application for legal aid has to be made in person generally and not through an authorized representative (except in cases of children or person with mental illness). The legal aid application has to be accompanied by the Affidavit sworn by the person seeking grant of legal aid (when a person is claiming free legal aid based on annual income criteria) and such an Affidavit cannot be made on behalf of some other person. However, in some cases, if the person seeking legal aid is incapacitated for some reason to apply in person for legal aid, his duly authorized representative/ person holding his General Power of Attorney may apply for legal aid.
