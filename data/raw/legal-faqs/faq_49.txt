Q: 49.	Do Legal Services help with legal issues related to land and property disputes?
A: Yes. One may still apply for free legal aid. However, before assignment of a legal aid counsel, the person may have to furnish a No Objection Certificate from the earlier counsel or copy of judicial order discharging the private counsel (where applicable).
