Q: 51.	Can Legal Services Institutions assist in cases of wrongful incarceration or miscarriage of justice?
A: No. The very fact that a person belongs to the SC/ST community entitles him to get free legal aid. The legal aid application needs to be supported by a certificate issued by the appropriate authority in this regard.
