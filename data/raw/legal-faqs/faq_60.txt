Q: 60.	When can legal aid be denied or withdrawn?
A: Paralegal volunteers (PLVs) are volunteers selected from diverse social and educational backgrounds through the process of NALSAâ€™s Para-Legal Volunteers Scheme. They are expected to act as intermediaries in bridging the gap between the common people and the Legal Services Institutions reaching out to the people at their doorsteps.
