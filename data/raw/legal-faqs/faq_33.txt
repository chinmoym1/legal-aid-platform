Q: 33. Can a person apply for free legal aid in a case in which he was earlier being represented by another private counsel?
A: A child is eligible for free legal aid till the age of majority i.e. 18 years. This is provided in Section 12 (c) of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987. So, any child can apply for free legal aid till he turns 18 years old.
