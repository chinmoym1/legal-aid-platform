Q: 83.	How does NALSA and other Legal Services Institutions promote legal awareness?
A: One can approach the Lok Adalat even at the pre-litigation stage (i.e. before a case is filed in the Court of law). If a case falling under the above category is pending in the Court, the concerned party may request the Court to have the matter referred to the Lok Adalat.
