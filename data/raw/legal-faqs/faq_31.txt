Q: 31. If a person has an annual income which is more than the amount prescribed under the Legal Services Authorities Act/ extant rules in this regard in the different states, can he still get free legal aid if he falls within any other category of beneficiaries enlisted in Section 12 of the Legal Services Authorities Act?
A: According to Section 13 (1) of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, any individual who satisfies any criteria under Section 12 is entitled to receive legal services, provided that the concerned Legal Services Institution is satisfied that such person has a genuine case to prosecute or defend the matter. There is hence, no bar as to which kind of cases one can apply and not apply for. All kinds of cases are included as long as the individual satisfies the eligibility under Section 12 of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987.
