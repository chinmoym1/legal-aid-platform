Q: 10. Does one have to pay any charge/fee for acquiring or submitting an application form for free legal aid?
A: Section 8A of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, provides that the SLSA shall constitute a Committee to be called the High Court Legal Services Committee (HCLSC) for every High Court, for the purpose of exercising such powers and performing such functions as may be determined by Regulations made by the State Authority. It is headed by a sitting Judge of the concerned High Court, as the Chairman. HCLSCs have been established to provide free and competent legal services to weaker sections of the society who wish to file or defend a case in the concerned High Court of a State.
