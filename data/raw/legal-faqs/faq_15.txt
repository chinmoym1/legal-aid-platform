Q: 15. How can one give feedback on the services provided by the Legal Services Institutions under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987?
A: Legal Advice and Assistance is the provision of advice on general areas of law as governed by the laws of India by the lawyers employed with the Legal Services Institution concerned. For e.g. if a person has to file a case in court, he would be provided legal aid (in form of assignment of a Legal Services Advocate). However, if he only needs some help in drafting a legal notice to be sent prior to filing of a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act 1881, he would get legal consultation/ advice regarding the same. A person who does not come under the purview of Section 12 of Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, to be eligible for free legal aid, can still avail legal advice and assistance from the Legal Services Institutions.
