Q: 64. What is a Lok Adalat?
A: A victim of domestic violence can file an application for free legal aid in her nearest Legal Services Institution. She can also seek compensation under the NALSA’s Compensation Scheme for Women Victims/Survivors of Sexual Assault/Other Crimes – 2018. The concerned Legal Services Institution can assist such a woman in filing court cases. Such a woman can also be provided counselling services. Further, the Legal Services Institution can also collaborate with various NGOs, Women Cells etc. which can then provide specialised assistance in such cases.
