Q: 63.	Can a person get legal advice for more than one matter?
A: Yes. Legal Services Institutions are duty bound to provide legal aid to such categories of persons as well as per Section 12(c) of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987. Section 40 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 also provides for the same. NALSA has also come up with a Scheme titled “Compensation Scheme for Women Victims/Survivors of Sexual Assault/other Crimes – 2018”, which has been used as a template by other States to formulate a Scheme for victim compensation. Victims of sexual crimes are paid compensation in terms of the prevailing schemes for victim compensation and the SLSAs are the disbursement authority for the compensation.
